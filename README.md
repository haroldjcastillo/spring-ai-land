While Dan demonstrates the workshop using OpenAI as the AI provider, I have chosen to use Ollama, an open-source
platform that allows running various large language models locally. This approach enables experimentation with different
models, provides more control over data privacy, and avoids reliance on external APIs or cloud services.
